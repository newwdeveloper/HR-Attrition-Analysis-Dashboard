- **Source**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)).
- **Size**: 1,470 rows, 35 columns (e.g., Age, JobSatisfaction, MonthlyIncome, Attrition).

## Data Cleaning
- **Power Query Steps**:
  - Removed null values in `JobSatisfaction` (less than 1% missing).
  - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., `Attrition: Yes/No` to 1/0 for calculations).
  - Created derived columns, like `Tenure_Bucket` (e.g., 0-3 years, 4-7 years).
- **Challenges**: Handled inconsistent formats in `Education` field by standardizing to numerical scale.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Attrition Rate**: 16% overall, with Sales (20%) and R&D (18%) highest.
- **Demographics**: Age 18-25 has 25% attrition; bachelorâ€™s degree holders leave more.
- **Satisfaction**: Low job satisfaction (<2) doubles turnover risk.
- **Compensation**: Employees earning <$5,000/month have 25% attrition.
- **Career Development**: No promotions in 3+ years increases turnover to 22%.

## Visualizations
- **Overview**: Cards for total employees, attrition rate; stacked bar for department breakdown.
- **Demographics**: Pie charts for age/gender, heatmap for correlations.
- **Satisfaction**: Gauges for satisfaction scores, Key Influencers for drivers.
- **Compensation**: Scatter plot for income vs. attrition, box plot for salary distribution.
- **Career Development**: Line chart for tenure, bar chart for promotions.

## DAX Measures
- `Attrition Rate = DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER(Table, [Attrition]="Yes")), COUNTROWS(Table))`
- `Avg Job Satisfaction = AVERAGE(Table[JobSatisfaction])`
- `Sales Attrition = CALCULATE([Attrition Rate], Table[Department]="Sales")`

## Key Takeaways
