# Employee Attrition Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Dataset, built with Power BI to uncover why employees leave and propose retention strategies. The interactive dashboard explores demographics, job satisfaction, compensation, and career development, delivering actionable insights to reduce turnover costs.

### Key Features
- **Dataset**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset (1,470 rows, 35 columns) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
- **Tools**: Power BI (Power Query for cleaning, DAX for calculations, AI visuals like Key Influencers).
- **Skills Demonstrated**:
  - Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
  - Visualization: Created interactive dashboards with bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.
  - Analysis: Identified key attrition drivers (e.g., low satisfaction, salary gaps).
  - Storytelling: Delivered actionable HR recommendations.

### Repository Structure
- `Employee_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI file with the full dashboard.
- `data/Employee_Attrition.csv`: Open dataset from kaggle.
- `screenshots/`: Dashboard screenshots for quick viewing.
- `docs/Exploratory_Analysis.md`: Details on data cleaning and EDA.
- `docs/Presentation_Script.md`: Presentation script for storytelling.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for open-source sharing.

### How to Use
1. **Open the Dashboard**: Download `Employee_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix` and open in Power BI Desktop.
2. **Explore Data**: View the raw dataset in `data/Employee_Attrition.csv` (subset).
3. **Review Analysis**: See `docs/Exploratory_Analysis.md` for methodology.
4. **Presentation**: Follow `docs/Presentation_Script.md` for a guided tour.

### Key Insights
- Attrition rate: 16%, highest in Sales (20%).
- Young employees (18-25) and low earners (<$5,000/month) have higher turnover.
- Low job satisfaction doubles attrition risk.
- Recommendations: Boost satisfaction, adjust salaries, and increase promotions.
